<h2>‚öîÔ∏èSlash Commands: </h2>
Slash commands are a type of command that starts with a forward slash ("/") followed by a keyword or action, similar to how you might use commands in a text-based interface or a command-line interface. These commands allow you to perform various actions or interact with bots and features within Discord without needing to use a prefix like "!,"?".", or any custom prefix set by a bot. Slash commands make your bot easier to use and also reduce certain `if` statments during the development. 

<h2>üëåBenifits of Slash Commands: </h2>
<li>User-Friendly Interaction: Slash commands provide an intuitive and user-friendly way for users to interact with your bot. Users don't need to remember and type out complex prefixes or command structures, making it easier for them to use your bot's features.</li>

<li>Discoverability: Slash commands are discoverable within Discord. When users type a forward slash ("/"), Discord displays a list of available slash commands, making it easy for users to find and use your bot's functionality.</li>

<li>Structured Input: Slash commands often require specific parameters or options, which can help ensure that users provide the correct input. This reduces the likelihood of command errors and helps your bot perform tasks accurately.</li>

<li>Consistency: Slash commands follow a consistent syntax, making it easier for users to understand how to use different bot features. This can improve the overall user experience.</li>

<li>Reduced Command Conflicts: Slash commands are distinct and don't conflict with other bot command prefixes or chat messages. This reduces the chance of command overlap or interference with other bots on the same server.</li>

<li>Server-Scoped Commands: Discord allows you to define slash commands on a per-server basis, which means your bot can have different commands for different servers. This enables customization and tailoring of your bot's functionality to suit each server's needs.</li>

<li>Built-in Documentation: Discord provides a built-in way to document and describe your bot's slash commands. Users can access information about the commands directly within Discord, enhancing user understanding.</li>

<li>Interaction with Permissions: Slash commands can be configured to check user permissions before executing certain actions. This helps ensure that only authorized users can perform specific tasks, enhancing server security.</li>

<li>Integration with Bot Responses: You can pair slash commands with bot responses to provide immediate feedback or results when a user executes a command. This creates a more interactive and responsive bot experience.</li>

<li>Analytics and Insights: Some bot development frameworks and libraries offer analytics and insights into how users are interacting with your bot's slash commands. This data can help you refine and improve your bot's functionality over time.</li>

<li>Easier Bot Maintenance: Slash commands can make bot maintenance and updates easier. You can add or modify commands without needing to update complex command handling systems or change prefixes.</li>

<li>Multi-Platform Compatibility: Slash commands work across different Discord platforms, including desktop and mobile apps, ensuring a consistent experience for users regardless of their device.</li>

<h2>üì±Slash Command Handler: </h2>
<h3>About:</h3>
<p>Slash Command Handler and a prefix Command Handler are a bit different, and made in different ways however there main features are almost the same.Below you can see an explanation of the code in index.js, which is the Slash Command Handler.</p>
<li>Command Registration:

One of the primary responsibilities of a Slash Command Handler is to handle the registration of slash commands with the Discord API. This includes creating and defining the commands, then sending the registration request to Discord.

It organizes command data, such as the command name, description, and any additional options or parameters, making it easier to manage and update commands.</li>

<li>Command Execution:

After registration, the Command Handler listens for incoming interactions from users in response to slash commands. When a user triggers a slash command in a Discord server where the bot is present, the Discord API sends an interaction event to the bot.

The Command Handler processes these interaction events, identifies the invoked command, and routes the request to the appropriate command function or module for execution.

It manages the execution of commands by invoking the corresponding code logic, which can include sending responses, performing actions, or providing information to users.</li>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<li>Head over to the <a href = "https://github.com/Zemerik/Slash-Commnads/blob/main/index.js">index.js</a> file of this repo and copy paste the ENTIRE code into you main entry point. The main entry point is the mail file ofy your project, in apps/websites like Replit it is usually named `index.js` or `main.js` however you may have changed the name if you are uisng IDE's like Visual Studio Code or Nevoim. </li>

<h2>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èDeployment Script</h2>

<h3>About:</h3>

<p>The Deployment Script is a set of automated instructions that faciliate the process of deploying commands.</p>
<li>Command Registration:

The deployment script defines the structure and details of your slash commands. This includes specifying the command name, description, options, and other relevant metadata. </li>
<li>Authentication:

The script often handles authentication with Discord's API. It includes mechanisms to securely authenticate your bot with the Discord API using your bot token.</li>
<li>Command Deployment:

The main function of the script is to deploy (register) your slash commands with Discord's API. This involves making HTTP requests to Discord's API endpoints to create or update the commands on the Discord servers where your bot is active.</li>
<li>Server-Specific Deployment:

In some cases, your bot may be present on multiple Discord servers (guilds). The deployment script should have the capability to register slash commands on specific servers, allowing you to customize commands for each server if needed.</li>
<li>Validation and Error Handling:

The script should perform validation checks on the command data to ensure it adheres to Discord's requirements and constraints. It should also handle errors gracefully, providing informative messages or logs when issues arise during deployment.</li>
<li>Updating Commands:

Beyond initial deployment, the script should support updating or modifying existing slash commands. This allows you to make changes to your bot's commands without needing to manually delete and recreate them.</li>

<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<li>Create a file, and name it `deploy-commands.js`. Ensure that the file is not in any directory or folder (if you are uisng an IDE like Visual Studio Code then store it in the same place as your main entry point). </li>
<li>Head over to the <a href = "https://github.com/Zemerik/Slash-Commnads/blob/main/deploy-commands.js">deploy-commands.js</a> file of this repo and copy paste the ENTIRE code in your  `deploy-commands.js` file. </li>

<h2>‚ÑπÔ∏èConfig.json: </h2>

<h3>About: </h3>

<p>A JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file is a lightweight data interchange format used to store and exchange data between different systems. It's a text-based format that is easy for both humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. JSON files have become a common way to structure and transmit data on the internet and are widely used in various applications and programming contexts. Below are some key characteristics and uses of JSON files:</p>

<li>Data Representation: JSON files are primarily used to represent structured data, such as configuration settings, user preferences, or information retrieved from a database. This data can be in the form of key-value pairs, arrays, nested objects, and primitive data types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null).</li>

<li>Text-Based: JSON files are plain text files, which means they can be easily created and edited using a simple text editor. This human-readable format makes it convenient for developers to work with and troubleshoot.</li>

<li>Syntax: JSON follows a specific syntax, consisting of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}, where keys are strings enclosed in double quotes, followed by a colon, and values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null. Key-value pairs are separated by commas.</li>

<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<li>Create a new file in your project, and name it `config.json`. Ensure that the file is not in any directory or folder (if you are uisng an IDE like Visual Studio Code then store it in the same place as your main entry point). </li>
<li>Head over to the <a href = "https://github.com/Zemerik/Slash-Commnads/blob/main/config.json">config.json</a> file of this repo and copy paste the ENTIRE code in your `config.json` file.</li>
<li>Replace `Your bot token` on line `2` with the actual token of your bot (can be obtained from Developer Portal). </li>
<li>Replace `User ID/Client ID of your bot` on line `3` with User ID or Client ID of your bot (can be obtained from Developer Portal or by right clicking on your bot from the members list). </li>
<li>Replace `Server ID` with the server ID you want slash commands in (can be obtained by right clicking on the server). </li>

<h2>üìÇDirectory: </h2>

<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<li>After you have written your Slash Command Handler in your main file and the deployment script in another file, you need to create a folder named `commands`. In the folder that you just created, make a new subfolder, you can name it whatever you like and create as many as you want.</li>
<li>Go to any or your only subfoler, and create a new file named `ping.js`. `ping` will be the name of the command, as the name of you file before `.js` is `ping`. In there, you can add the code from the file `ping.js` in this repo.</li>
<li>Your project's directory should look like something below, ignore the files `kick.js`, `prune.js`, `avatar.js`, `reload.js`, `server.js` and `user.js`. Also note, that if you are using apps/websites like replit, then you may not even have the `node_modules` folder. </li>

<h2>üèÜDeploying: </h2>
<p>In order to register slash commands, you need to deploy your project. Your project can be deployed as many times you want and you will need to redeploy is countless times. Below is basic step by step instruction on how to deploy your slash commands. </p>

<li>Head over to your project's terminal/console, and enter `node deploy-commands.js`. If you have followed the instructions correctly, then it should display `Started refreshing 1 application (/) commands.` and then display `Successfully reloaded 1 application (/) commands.` in your console.</li>
<li>If anything other than that shows up in console, or there is some other error in the console, it is best to contact through the below links.</li>
<li>Also note, that every time you add a new commmand or edit one of your commands, you will need to do the deploying process again. Ensure that your project is not running while deploying commands as that could lead to several issues.</li>
